</ul>



## How to play:
  You're in control of a sphere which has three different colors. If you want to live, you have to match your sphere color with one of three colors of the wall. If you don't match the colors, you're going to lose your life, and eventually, end your game. You start with three lives and you can collect objects such as golden cube, which represents one in-game point and skyblue sphere, which represents a shield that can protect you in a short time period from any danger. After your score reaches value of 30, a new object called "bullet" enters the game and you have to avoid that object unconditionally or you loose your life. The game ends when you get bored or lose all of your lives.
